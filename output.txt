The applied moment exceeds the moment capacity! Moment capacity (Md): 10.00 kNm, Applied moment (M): 350.0 kNm.
To be safe, increase the section modulus (Ze) to at least 14000.00 mm³.

The applied shear force exceeds the shear capacity! Shear capacity (Vd): 0.13 kN, Applied shear (V): 750.0 kN.
To be safe, increase the shear area (A_v) to at least 6250.00 mm².
